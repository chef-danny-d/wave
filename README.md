# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to improve my coding skills, get feedback from the community, and expand my portfolio.

# Disclaimer
The mockup was NOT done by me nor will I ever claim the creation of it. Credit is provided to the author and I'm thankful that it was provided to me and the community for free. This project isn't intended to make any money nor will I ever sell this project or product created in this project. This project, as described above, is strictly only for my personal learning and improvement. The website isn't a complete replica of the wireframe. I made changes to it as I thought would look better in my eyes. You are more than welcomed to fork this repo and send me your done project if you have a better way of getting the point across for a potential customer.
